# CrossCodeCheats
A CCLoader port of the cheats from https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7934

To install with [CCLoader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) simply download and put the cheats folder into the CrossCode/assets/mods folder.

If you want to install the cheats into the game directly without using CCLoader then you can simple copy and paste the contents of cheats.js and append them to the end of your CrossCode/assets/js/game.compiled.js
