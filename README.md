# CrossCodeCheats
A CCLoader port of the cheats from the [fearlessrevolution forum](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7934). These cheats are configurable in-game via a menu you can access from the pause menu but you won't be able to save the changes yet (in-progress). If you want to change them longer term you can edit the cheats.js file and change the settings at the top of the file.

# Install

This mod requires [CCLoader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) which you can either install manually or use the [CCLoader installer](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/ccloader-installer).

Once you have CCLoader installed, you can install this mod by simply putting the downloaded CrossCodeCheats folder into `CrossCode/assets/mods`.

If you want to install the cheats into the game directly without using CCLoader then you can simply copy and paste the contents of cheats.js and append it to the end of your `CrossCode/assets/js/game.compiled.js` file.
