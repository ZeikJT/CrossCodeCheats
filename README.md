# CrossCodeCheats
A CCLoader port of the cheats from https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7934. These cheats are configurable in-game via a menu you can access from the pause menu but you won't be able to save the changes yet (in-progress). If you want to change them longer term you can edit the cheats/cheats.js file and edit the settings at the top of the file.

# Install

To install with [CCLoader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) simply download and put the cheats folder into the CrossCode/assets/mods folder.

If you want to install the cheats into the game directly without using CCLoader then you can simply copy and paste the contents of cheats.js and append it to the end of your CrossCode/assets/js/game.compiled.js
